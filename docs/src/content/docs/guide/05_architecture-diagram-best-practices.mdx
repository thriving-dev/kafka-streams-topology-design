*Work in progress...

## Challenges

- notation (shapes, edges, colors, lines and arrows)
- "I will explain it later"
  - Everything which is not described by the diagram itself is missing, and there is no room to provide verbal details to complement a diagram.
- Cluttered or too vague diagrams
  - trying to show too much or insufficient level of detail
- Misleading/undocumented acronyms or too vague/generic terms

## Best Practices

- keep structural and semantical consistency across diagrams
- prevent diagrams fragmentation
- keep traceability -> [Tips and Tricks](/guide/tips-and-tricks/)
- legends -> [Legend](/notation/basics/#legend)
