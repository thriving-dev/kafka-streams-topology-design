## Crafting Software Architecture Diagrams

<div>
  > **"Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler”**
  > Albert Einstein
</div>

This timeless quote serves as the guiding philosophy for creating effective software architecture diagrams. The goal
is to strike the perfect balance between simplicity and accuracy. Below are key principles to follow when designing
architecture diagrams:
<div class="[&_strong]:font-semibold">
1. **Start Simple, and Keep It Simple**
1. **Prioritize Clarity Over Completeness**
1. **Iterate and Add Details as the Design and Project Evolves**
</div>


### 1. **Start Simple, and Keep It Simple**
Just like any well-crafted system, your diagram should begin with a simple foundation. That's the topology, source, and
sink topics. Focus on the critical path of stream processing, only add additional details when necessary, omit otherwise.

Crafting & maintaining good diagrams takes time and effort.
<div class="leading-normal li0-mt-tight ul-mt-tight ml-4 pr-16">
  * prefer less/just enough over risk of fragmentation, outdated diagrams
  * define a weight for a certain diagram;
  level of importance -> time to spend on
  * include in user story acceptance criteria to update diagrams
</div>

### 2. **Prioritize Clarity Over Completeness**
The primary function of an architecture diagram is to convey the overall topology and flow of the system. Focus on the
elements that are critical for the reader’s understanding. Include the key topic information, data types, data flow,
context, and descriptions, but avoid cluttering the diagram with unnecessary details.

Just like with code coverage, perfection is not the goal. Your diagram should communicate the topology clearly, but
it's unnecessary (and often counterproductive if the diagram is too cluttered) to depict every detail.

This is particularly important for Kafka Streams Topology Designs. There's a lot of complexity under the hood of the
DSL that might not be relevant to your design.

Here's an example:

### 3. **Iterate and Add Details as the Design and Project Evolves**
Software architecture is not static, and neither should your diagrams be. As your project evolves, so will your
architecture.

This iterative process ensures that your diagrams remain useful and up-to-date throughout the lifecycle of the project.
