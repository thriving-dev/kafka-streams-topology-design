To fully explore the KSTD design standard, we'll start by setting up the work environment by adding the
component library to the drawing tool Excalidraw.

## Installation

**Step 1:** To install the Excalidraw library for this browser, **click** the following button


<div class="sl-flex">
    <CallToAction attrs={{class: "minimal !px-4", target: "_blank"}}
                  link={globals.lib.install}
                  icon={{type: 'icon', name: 'external'}}
                  variant="primary"
                  set:html="Install"/>
</div>

**Step 2:** Excalidraw will open in your browser, and ask for _confirmation_.
> "This will add _n_ shape(s) to your library. Are you sure?".

Approve with **OK**.

### Verify the Import

<TwoCols>
<div class="!mt-4">
    - Once confirmed, you should see the shapes or icons from the library appear in the Library panel.
    - You can now drag and drop these items onto your canvas.
</div>
<div class="flex justify-center items-center [&>*>img]:w-64">

</div>
</TwoCols>

### Install Manually

If this is not working for you, here are some simple steps to manually install the KSTD Excalidraw library:

**Step 1: Download the Library from GitHub**

Go to the repository ['./lib'](https://github.com/thriving-dev/kafka-streams-topology-design/tree/main/lib)
and download the latest version.

**Step 2: Open Excalidraw**

- Go to the [Excalidraw website](https://excalidraw.com/).
- You will see a blank canvas where you can start drawing or editing.

**Step 3: Import the Library**

- Open the Library Panel:
  - Click on the "Library" button (looks like a book) located on the top-right.
- Import Library:
  - In the Library panel, click on the "Three Dots" button (right to "Browse libraries").
  - Click "Open"
  - Choose the `.excalidrawlib` file you downloaded in Step 1.
- Verify the Import:
  - Once the file is loaded, you should see the shapes or icons from the library appear in the Library panel.
  - You can now drag and drop these items onto your canvas.
