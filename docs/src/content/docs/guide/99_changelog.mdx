    ## Version 1.0.0-alpha.4
    The Excalidraw component library contains *67 shapes*.
    [Install v1.0.0-alpha.4](https://excalidraw.com/#addLibrary=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fthriving-dev%2Fkafka-streams-topology-design%2Fmain%2Flibs%2Fkafka-streams-topology-design_v1.0.0-alpha.4.excalidrawlib).

    ### Notable changes

    #### Introducing 'shapes' for DSL operators
    Previously, all DSL operators were visualized in a _circular shape_. From this version onwards, the notation has been extended to differentiate between _four basic shapes_ to subtly provide hints on the operator's processing characteristics and how this affects the topology.

    The new shapes are defined as follows:
    * **circular**: basic behaviour; no changes to the record key/value; stateless
    * **square**: stateful; uses state stores and, by default, leads to an internal changelog topic to be created in Kafka
    * **diamond**: key-changing operator, may lead to an internal repartitioning topic to be created in Kafka on subsequent operations
    * **square+diamond**: potentially both key-changing and stateful

    PS: The new shapes, part of the new 'Legend' component, are shown below.

    #### New library component: 'Legend'
    * A basic diagram legend has been created
    * Comes in two variants: _portrait_ & _landscape_ orientation

    #### Topic components revised
    * There are now three different variants provided for Kafka Topics
    * **Basic**: pipe shape and topic name; without the Kafka logo
    * **Default**: pipe shape with a small Kafka logo; topic name + basic topic config in 2nd line of the text
    * **Plus**: pipe shape next to the large Kafka logo; topic name + advanced topic config in subsequent lines of the text

    #### Numeric footnote indicators / Use-case example steps
    * A new purple-coloured circular 'button'; 2 digits (0..99)
    * No strict guidelines or purpose, but it can be useful to add, e.g.
    * numbered indicators to add footnotes for specific details in the diagram
    * outline process flow (or orchestration) steps to describe how a particular complex use case is handled by the topology and/or business logic

    #### New toggle descriptor for 'Read-only State Stores'
    * ref [KIP-813](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-813%3A+Shareable+State+Stores)
    * ref [The Mysteries of KIP-813](https://medium.com/confluent/the-mysteries-of-kip-813-8fd2e85ac1d9) by Matthias J. Sax
