  Explore KSTD designs of different types of Kafka Streams applications, ranging from pure DSL topologies, to low level
  implementation of the Processor API and state stores.

  <Aside type="tip">
      All examples on this page are **SVG** files (Scalable Vector Graphics) with _embedded excalidraw scene data_.

      => This means, you can **save the `.svg` file** to your local disk, and **_open_ with Excalidraw!**

  ## Examples

  ### Word Count
  The WordCount Demo design is a relatively **simple example and a good starting point**.

  To find more details on this example, including a step-by-step guide to recreate the diagram by yourself, please start with the
  [tutorial](/guide/tutorial-creating-your-first-diagram/).

  ### Ecommerce Product View

  This Kafka Streams topology creates a full-context view for a product of an Ecommerce application from 5 data streams.
  The source topics have different no. of partitions, and also different keys and scope.

  Through transformations, joins, and aggregations, all data streams are combined to create a view of a product
  that may come in multiple variants (e.g. colors), each with its own price, stock, and availability. Variants form
  a 'product group' that have certain product details (description) and various attributes in common.

  <Aside title="Highlights">
  - Uses Kafka Streams **DSL** only
  - Source topics have different _no. of partitions_ **-> repartitioning required**
  - Through repartitioning and a subsequent join, the topology splits into **two sub-topologies** which are also shown in the diagram
  - **Event _types_ and _serialization_** are shown as the data **progresses** throughout the streams using 'KV Record - Typed' library components
  - Concise **hints** are shown _"inline"_ for some of the processing steps to improve clarity to the reader

  #### Events
  - **ProductDescription Event**: Provides basic product information such as name, description, and category.
  - **ProductAttribute Event**: Represents attributes of a product such as material, color options, or features.
  - **ProductVariant Event**: Defines product variants such as different sizes or colors for the same product.
  - **ProductVariantPrice Event**: Provides pricing information for a specific product variant, including discounts.
  - **ProductVariantStock Event**: Provides stock and availability information for a product variant.
  - **ProductFullContext Event**: This event holds all information about a product, including its description, attributes, variants, pricing, stock, and availability. It is designed to offer a full-context view of a product in the eCommerce system, which can be used for enriching product displays, recommendations, or inventory management.


  ### User Flight Booking - Status Update Notifications

  A travel company offers booking flights through their website. To notify users about any changes or updates to their
  flight bookings in real-time, a stream processing application is implemented.

  Flight status updates, such as 'check-in started', or 'flight cancelled', have to be communicated to all relevant users
  in their configured communication channels (email, app, text message). The notification text should include event
  details, as well as information on the departure, layover, and destination airports in both English and in their
  preferred language.

  Data streams are available as three Kafka topics. User notifications are triggered via a 'Notification Service' REST API.

  <Aside title="Highlights">
    - Uses Kafka Streams **Processor API** (short _PAPI_)
    - Processors _read/write_ to **state stores** of different _types_ and _variants_
    - Advanced PAPI usage:
      - **Punctuator** is used by the _FlightBookingProcessor_ incl. the schedule
      - **Interactive Queries** are used to implement and query a _one-to-many_ relationship, described in the diagram _"inline"_
    - **Event _types_ and _serialization_** are shown as the data **progresses** throughout the streams using 'KV Record - Typed' library components
    - **Named processors** incl. sources and sinks, and state stores
    - **Step descriptions** in the _footer_ provide _roles and responsibilities_, and additional _functional context_ for processors and DSL operators

                 alt="'Kafka Streams Topology Design' diagram for the example app 'User Flight Booking - Status Update Notifications'"/>

  #### Events
  - **AirportInfoI18n Event**: transports information about airports globally in different languages. The schema includes mandatory information in English, with the option to include translations in other languages.
  - **FlightStatusUpdate Event**: focuses on the flight as a whole rather than just the departure airport. It includes information about the current status of the flight, any changes to the flight schedule, and delays.
  - **UserFlightBooking Event**: holds information about a traveler’s booked flight, including reservation details, contact information, and preferred language for notifications.
  - **UserFlightBookingNotification Event**: joins and combines information from _UserFlightBooking_, _Flight_, _FlightStatusUpdate_, and _AirportInfoI18n_ into an enriched output event, which is emitted on all flight status updates

  ## Disclaimer ❗
  The examples presented on this page demonstrate advanced Kafka Streams topologies. While they address real-world
  challenges, please note that these scenarios are _fictional_, designed to **illustrate practical applications of
  the KSTD standard** — _not_ to provide a comprehensive tutorial on Kafka Streams itself.

  The designs were created with the author’s best efforts to be both realistic and implementable within the outlined
  requirements. However, they may not represent the optimal or most efficient solutions.
