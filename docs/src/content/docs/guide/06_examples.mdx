# {frontmatter.title}

Explore KSTD designs of different types of Kafka Streams applications, ranging from pure DSL topologies, to low level
implementation of the Processor API and state stores.

    <Aside type="note" title="Disclaimer">
        The examples presented on this page demonstrate advanced Kafka Streams topologies. While they address real-world
        challenges, please note that these scenarios are _fictional_, designed to **illustrate practical applications of
        the KSTD standard** — _not_ to provide a comprehensive tutorial on Kafka Streams itself.

        The designs were created with the author’s best efforts to be both realistic and implementable within the outlined
        requirements. However, they may not represent the optimal or most efficient solutions.

    <Aside type="tip">
        All examples on this page are **SVG** files (Scalable Vector Graphics) with _embedded excalidraw scene data_.

        This means, you can save the `.svg` file to you local disk, and _open_ the SVG file with Excalidraw.

### Ecommerce Product View

This Kafka Streams topology creates a full-context view for a product of an Ecommerce application from 5 data streams.
The source topics have different no. of partitions, and also different keys and scope.

Through transformations, joins, and aggregations, all data streams are combined to create a view of a product
that may come in multiple variants (e.g. colors), each with its own price, stock, and availability. Variants form
a 'product group' that have certain product details (description) and various attributes in common.

### User Flight Booking - Status Update Notifications

A travel company offers booking flights through their website. To notify users about any changes or updates to their
flight bookings in real-time, a stream processing application is implemented.

Flight status updates, such as 'check-in started', or 'flight cancelled', have to be communicated to all relevant users
in their configured communication channels (email, app, text message). The notification text should include event
details, as well as information on the departure, layover, and destination airports in both English and in their
preferred language.

Data streams are available as three Kafka topics. User notifications are triggered via a 'Notification Service' REST API.
