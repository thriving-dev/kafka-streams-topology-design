Adding descriptions to technical diagrams is essential for clarity, accessibility, and understanding. They explain components and relationships, helping viewers grasp complex systems, and provide important context that diagrams alone lack. Descriptions also reduce ambiguity and enhance the quality of documentation by integrating visuals with text. Additionally, they support collaboration by ensuring a shared understanding among stakeholders, making diagrams more effective tools for communication and learning.
