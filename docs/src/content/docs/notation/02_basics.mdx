## Components

### Header
<LibraryComponent name="header"
                  width={268}
                  title="Header."
                  description="<br/>Every diagram should have a title, date and version. (Also see <a href='/guide/architecture-diagrams-best-practices/'>Architecture Diagram - Best Practices</a>)"/>

### Topology
<LibraryComponent name="topology" width={197} description="
<p><b>The topology</b> in Kafka Streams represents the logical abstraction layer that defines the data flow and processing logic between streams and state stores in a stream processing application.</p>
<p>It's the outer most building block for your application and one of the library components you begin your design with.</p>
"/>

### Sub-Topology
<LibraryComponent name="sub-topology" width={119} description="<b>A sub-topology</b> is an isolated section of a Kafka Streams topology that processes data independently from other parts, typically due to repartitioning or multiple input topics." />

### Legend Portrait/Landscape
<LibraryComponent name="kstd-legend-portrait"
                  width={280}
                  title="Diagram Legend."
                  description="<p>Basic key/legend that descibes the notation defined by KSTD.</p>
                               <p>Includes a block of 4 shapes used by the Kafka Streams DSL Operators.</p>
                               <p>Further KSTD destinguishes between two arrow types:
                                 <ol><li>The solid line arrow shows the data flow through the stream procesing topology.</li>
                                     <li>For everything else (e.g. IQ, RPC, or other access patterns), a dashed line arrow is used.</li></ol>
                                 </p>
                               <p>Then there's the representation used for topics and state stores.</p>
                               <p>Last but not least a reference and link to the KSTD docs.</p>"/>
