## Components

### Topic
**A Kafka topic** is a named, partitioned, and immutable log of messages where producers send data, and consumers read
from, allowing for organized and scalable data streaming in Kafka.

In KSTD diagrams, topics are commonly used to show **_sources_ and _sinks_**.

Three different variants of topic components are provided. The default content included serves as a guideline.
Choose the one you like and add details such as topic config parameters when they are essential to the topology design.

<LibraryComponent name="topic-1"
                  width={115}
                  title="Topic 'Simple'."
                  description="<br/>The most basic topic component. Icon and topic name."/>
<LibraryComponent name="topic-2"
                  width={231}
                  title="Topic the Apache Kafka® logo."
                  description="<br/>In addition to the topic name, additional configuration details may be included in a 2nd line in parenthesis."/>
<LibraryComponent name="topic-3"
                  width={258}
                  title="Topic the Apache Kafka® logo (2)."
                  description="<br/>An alternative choice to the previous component.<br/>More topic config options can be included, listed line-by-line."/>

    **Internal topics** in Kafka Streams are automatically managed Kafka topics used to store intermediate data, such as
    state store _changelogs_ and _repartitioned_ data, to support fault tolerance and scalability within stream processing
    applications.

    As per our [standard](/guide/kstd-standard/) and [design principles](/guide/design-principles/),
    **_changelog & repartition topics_ are not included** in the diagram. They usually don't provide additional value and
    only clutter the diagram.

    But remember, it's up to you. Draw what you feel is right and works best for you.

### Key-Value Record
In a Kafka Streams topology, **data flows as _records_**, each consisting of a _key_, _value_, and associated _metadata_ (like timestamps). These records can undergo multiple transformations, and their data types for both keys and values may change between operations such as map(), flatMap(), or groupBy().

Kafka Streams uses **SerDes** (Serializer/Deserializer) to convert data types between their in-memory representations (e.g., Java objects) and their serialized form (e.g., JSON, Avro, or bytes) for transport within Kafka.

The 'Key-Value Record' component usually is added to describe the type and content of your data throughout the topology.
It's commonly added for _sources_ & _sinks_, and whenever it changes. Further, it is also used
in combination with [state stores](/notation/state-stores/).

<LibraryComponent name="record-kv"
                  width={110}
                  title="Key-Value Record."
                  description="<p>Describes the record key (k) and value (v). For generic types, it can be the name of an <i>identifier</i>. For complex objects, such as Avro or Protobuf, the <i>record</i> name is usually a good choice.</p>
                               <p>Compound string keys can be described like this: <code>{departureDate}_{flightNumber}</code></p>"/>

<LibraryComponent name="record-kv-typed"
                  width={111}
                  title="Key-Value Record Typed."
                  description="<br>Includes information on the SerDes and the resulting data types."/>

<div class="[&_aside]:text-md">
  <Aside>
    SerDes may change throughout the topology as different operations are applied, ensuring correct serialization at each step.
    -	**Initial SerDes:** The SerDes for the source topic might, for example, deserialize a record key as a String and value as an Avro object.
    -	**Transformations:** If the topology applies a transformation (e.g., converting a ProductEvent into a ProductView), the SerDes can change accordingly, requiring a new SerDe for the transformed object.
    -	**Repartitioning:** Operations like groupBy() or selectKey() change the key type, often requiring a repartitioning topic with its own SerDe for the new key-value structure.
    -	**State Stores:** If stateful processing is used (e.g., aggregations), internal changelog topics will store serialized state data using SerDes that correspond to the in-memory structure of the state store.
